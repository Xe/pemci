Nameless Boy
------------

Beyond the frontier  
where borders blur into unknown thoughts  
there is a nameless boy --   
a drop of pure human light.  
Through narrow cracks in the splintered fence  
I watch his innocence with envy,  
searching for the right meaning of his movements.  
The twilight of his smile  
nourishes my heart  
like crumbs of God's light.  
A longing in my mouth to speak,  
to weep,  
and gather this child into my arms  
and encipher his nature into mine.  
Through the exchange of eyes --  
glances, purloined and routed into blindness,  
our language annulled.  
I can only grope towards him  
with antenna thoughts  
that dance in praise of his youthful beauty.  

I am waiting for stones to bloom.  
For venomous skies to wander into oblivion.  
For tracks to emerge like dust in a beam of light.  

Life's clever poison  
is closing the gate.  
The cracks are mended -- the vision expunged.  
And the nameless boy dissolves,  
for there was no earth inside him.
