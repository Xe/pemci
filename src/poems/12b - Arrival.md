Arrival
-------

I have held a vigil for lucidity  
out in the horizonless fields where nothing shines  
but the light of my fire  
and the silver disk of the endless night.  

Suddenly, it's clear that I'm alone in the wilderness  
without human eyes to reach in to.  
Alone with my treasure of sounds  
in the pure silence of arrival.
