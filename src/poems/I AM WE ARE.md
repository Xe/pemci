I AM WE ARE
-----------

We are specks of sky,  
a silent choir of pounding hearts.  
We are an eyelid  
the size of a galaxy,  
opening like a rising sun.  
If you look out of it  
you are absorbed in  
I am we are—  
whirling in the curvature  
of a universe cathedral.  
Sound is unity.  
Long waves lack horizons,  
their roadmaps  
penned from the Creator’s heart,  
boomerang.  
Listen…  
do you hear the subtle, undulating seams  
through which you can pass?  
There…  
there…  
and there…  
∞  
Behind the overgrown weeds  
the song leads to  
I am we are.  
It may seem unlikely  
that what is small  
and commonly ignored  
is powerful,  
but  
root  
feeds  
leaf.  
True power waits in the whisper.  
Beneath the ground state.  
It is rested.  
It does not flex,  
pounce,  
grip,  
or grab,  
for it is not of muscle.  
Or bone.  
Or mind.  
Or even humanness.  
Remember that.  
Power is not  
what you have  
been taught.  
Power is  
the internal gaze  
that discerns  
I am we are,  
and then dresses our every deed  
in that finery  
and nothing more.  
In the same way that white light  
is nothing more than  
all colors.  
∞  
We are bodies of air.  
Deeper, we are not bodies at all.  
We are the  
Sovereign Integral…  
That which is  
I  
and  
we  
at one time.  
One place.  
One and equal.  
No dominance.  
Equipoise.  
We are invisible numbers  
more than gathered letters,  
atop the Periodic Table.  
Sound  
more than mass.  
Depth  
more than skin.  
We are a bucket brigade  
to the fires of ego and separation.  
Our “water” is  
I am we are.  
∞  
We arm-wrestle the limbless soul.  
We point our fingers at the mirror  
that dares to lecture.  
We stare into ourselves  
and test:  
“Am I?”  
“Are we?”  
“Really?”  
Beautiful clarity,  
the sated view  
is often heard first  
and followed least.  
We grow in unseen places.  
Come alive in the music  
of quiet spaces  
porous with pauses  
and the rounded sound of soaring feathers.  
∞  
The eyelid opens.  
Canopied hues of blue, green, brown, and gray  
come alive,  
endless in their bidding to discover  
I am we are.  
It is this and nothing more,  
in the same way that white light  
is nothing more than  
all colors.
