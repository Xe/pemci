Another
-------

One skin may hide another,  
I remember this from a poem when I  
launched a fire across a field of deadness.  
At least, to me, it seemed dead.  
I felt like a liberator of life force  
renewing the blistered and dying grasses.  
Actually, more weeds than grass,  
but nonetheless, the flora had flat-lined.  
I peeled back skin with holy flame  
and brought everything to black again  
as though I called the night to descend.  
From blackness will arise a new skin  
cresting green architecture from a fertile void.  

As the flames spread their inviolable enchantment  
I saw your face spreading across my mind.  
Remember the fire we held?  
I hoped it would unfurl a new skin  
for us as well.  
Forever it will roam inside me  
invariant to all transformations and motions.  
(Einstein smiling.)  

One person may hide another,  
but behind you, love is molting a thicker skin  
than I can see through.  
No flame can touch its center.  
No eyes can browse its memory.  
I want nothing behind you in wait.  
Seconds tick away like children growing  
in between photographs.  
I will not forget you in the changes.  
Cursed with memory so fine  
I can trace your palm.   
I can inhale your sweet breath.  
I can linger in your arms' weight.  
I can hear your exquisite voice   
calibrate life with celestial precision.  

One purpose may hide another.  
I heard this as the fire died out  
to reveal the scent of the wet earth  
and growing things.  
I could feel my love decompose  
returning to the uninhabited realm  
where it belongs.  
Where all hearts belong when  
love is lost, and the code of the mute,  
coiled in fists that pound,  
reveal the wisdom of another.
