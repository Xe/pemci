Life Carriers
-------------

Life carriers spawn in the primal waters  
of a giant embryo.  
Their progeny will settle in human dust.  
Pieces of clay  
with tiny thoughts of flight.  
Knife-points veiled in turbid cloaks  
that shun the light of a tranquil star.  

In the remote wilds the life carriers  
emerge and perch upon  
the shoulders of gray stones.  
They signal their desires to fly,   
but their homes are suited   
for the comforts of rain and earth.  
The sky must wait.  
(The dirt companion smiles.)  

Circles break.   
Barriers overrun.  
Life carriers deny their ancient pull   
from the ground.  
Wings sprout like golden hair   
sinuous with nature's artifice.  
Ragged feet are left behind.  
The earth replaced with vivid sky.  
Gravity shines its menacing stare  
to hold them   
with assertive hands.  

Homeless cages  
are left to rot.  
To sink behind the groundless sky.  
Earthen faces have dropped their smiles  
and lost their smell of fresh dirt.  
The dream of flight   
has invaded somber walls --   
life carriers have bounded  
to the other side.  
There they meet the next rung  
of the endless ladder,  
and trade their wings for wisdom's eye.
