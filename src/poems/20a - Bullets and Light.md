Bullets and Light
-----------------

I am adrift tonight  
as though a privilege denied  
is the passageway to keep body and soul together.  
You have kept so much at bay  
I wonder if your enchantment is to tame passion.  
Cornered by your savage artillery  
you sling your bullets like schools of fish  
darting to a feast,  
and I surge ahead tired of being the food.  
When I look back  
I can see fragments of you  
hiding in the underbrush,  
stubborn remnants of your vanished heart.  
I can still love them.  
I can still hold their fragile nerves  
clustered with a welder's tongue  
seething light as pure as any ever beheld.  

Perhaps I drift away because of the chasm I see.  
Bullets and light.  
How strange bedfellows can be.  
But you will never confess  
nor shed your doubt of me.  
I will always remain an enigma hurling itself  
like litter across your absolute path.  
A sudden shaft of light that begets a deep shadow  
that temporarily blinds.  

Hope-stirred eyes have always sought to steal  
you from the simian nature that collects at your feet  
and pulls at you like derelict children.  
My unearthly hunger drew me away from you,  
even against my will, or at least my conscious will.  
There was always something calculating  
the distance between us.  
Some cosmic abacus shuffling sums  
of bullets and light  
looking for the ledger's balance,  
but never quite locating its exact frequency.
