Imperishable
------------

Through this night I have slept little.  
My eyes, closed like shutters   
with slats that remain open,  
wait to invent dreams   
of some charred reality.  
I sense you, but no weight on my bed.  
No shift or creaking other   
than my own restlessness.  

Wandering words  
self-gathered, self-formed,  
and released to the night  
like a mantra slowly drowned in music.  
Your presence grew with the music  
devouring it in silence.  
You came to me so clear  
my senses aroused in electric storms of clarity.  
The buzz of mercury lamps  
alongside rutted roads,  
shedding their weightless light.  

In all of this waiting for you  
no fortress or foxhole bears my name.  
I lay on the Savannah   
staring at the sun hoping against hope   
it blinks before I do.  
My wounded cells,  
tiny temples of our mixture,  
have weakened in your absence.  
I can feel them wail in their miniature worlds.  
My feet resist their numbness,  
deny them their war.  

As I lay here alone   
waiting to be gathered into your arms,   
I ask of you one thing,  
remember me as this.  
Remember me as one who loves you  
beyond yourself.  
Who pierces shells, armor, masks,   
and everything protecting  
your spirit in needless fervor.  
Remember me as this.  
As one who loves you unmatched  
by the deepest channels   
that have ever been forged.  
Who will love you anywhere and always.  

And if you look very closely at my love   
you will not find an expiration date,  
but instead, the word, imperishable.
