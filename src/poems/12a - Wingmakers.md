WingMakers
----------

I am destined to sit on the riverbank  
awaiting words from the naked trees  
and brittle flowers that have lost their nectar.  
A thousand unblinking eyes   
stare out across the water  
from the other side.  
Their mute voices seek rewards of another kind.  
Their demure smiles leave me hollow.  

Am I a perpetual stranger to myself?  
(The thought brands me numb.)  
Am I an orphan trailing pale shadows  
that lead to a contemptuous mirror?  
Where are these gossamer wings that my  
destiny foretold?  
I am waiting for the river to deliver them to me;  
to lodge them on the embankment  
at my feet.  

My feet are shackles from another time.  
My head, a window long closed  
to another place.  
Yet, there are places  
that salvage the exquisite tongue  
and assemble her wild light  
like singing birds the sun.  
I have seen these places among the stillness   
of the other side.  
Calling like a lover's kiss   
to know again what I have known before;  
to reach into the Harvest  
and leave my welcome.  

These thoughts are folded so neatly   
they stare like glass eyes fondling the past.  
I listen for their guidance  
but serpentine fields are my pathway.  
When I look into the dark winds  
of the virtual heart  
I can hear its voice saying:  
"Why are you trapped with wings?"  
And I feel like a grand vision inscribed in sand  
awaiting an endless wind.  

Will these wings take me  
beneath the deepest camouflage?  
Will they unmask the secret measures  
and faithful dwellings of time?  
Will they search out the infinite spaces  
for the one who can define me?  

Wings are forgotten by all who travel with their feet.  
Lines have been drawn so many times  
that we seldom see the crossing  
of our loss though we feel the loss of our crossing.  
We sense the undertow of clouds.  
The gravity of sky.  
The painless endeavor of hope's silent prayers.  
But our wings shorn of flight  
leave us like newborn rivers that babble over rocks  
yearning for the depths of a silent sea.  

I have found myself suddenly old.  
Like the blackbirds that pour   
from the horizon line,  
my life has soared over this river searching for my wings.  
There is no other key for me to turn.  
There is no other legend for me to face.  
Talking to flowers and gnarled trees  
will only move me a step away --   
when I really want to press my face   
against the windowpane  
and watch the WingMakers craft my wings.
