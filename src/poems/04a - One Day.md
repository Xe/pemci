One Day
-------

One day,  
out of this fleshy cocoon  
I will rise like a golden bird of silent wing  
graceful as the smoke of a fallen flame.  
I will dream no more of places  
Hidden -- secreted away in heaven's cleft  
where the foot leaves no print.  

One day,  
I will walk in gardens holding hands  
with my creation and creator.  
We will touch one another  
like lovers torn by death  
to say goodbye.  
We will lay in one another's arms  
until we awaken as one  
invisible to the other.  

One day,  
I will isolate the part of me  
that is always present.  
I will dance with it  
like moonlight on water.  
I will hold it to myself in a longful embrace  
that beats perfection  
in the hymn of the Songkeeper.  

One day,  
when I curl away inside myself  
I will dream of you  
this flesh-covered-bone of animal.  
I will yearn to know your life again.  
I will reach out to you  
as you now reach out to me.  
Such magic!  
Glory to covet the unknown!  
That which is  
is always reaching for the self   
that cheats appearances.  
Who dreams itself awake and asleep.  
Who knows both sides of the canvas  
are painted, awaiting the other  
to meld anew.
