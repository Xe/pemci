Empyrean
--------

He walked a higher ground  
like a soul untethered to human flesh.  
Darkness implored--  
demanded his searching stop  
and match the drifting gait of others.  
But his pathway unwound like a ball of string  
sent upward  
only to fall in a sentence of light.  
Collisions with fate would unrail him  
and send him the wishes of obscurity.  
The lightning of desire.  
The curse of empty dreams.  
The witness to unspeakable horrors.  

He would laugh at the absurdity,  
yet aware of the dark ripples  
that touched him.  
Humanity was a creaseless sheet of blank paper  
waiting to be colored and crumpled  
into pieces of prey for the beast-hunter.  
Why did they wait?  
The palette was for their taking.  
The "distance" betrayed them.  
The shallow grave of the deep heart  
killed their faith.  

He knew,  
yet could not form the words.  
Nor draw the map.  
The ancient casts of the empyrean  
withstood definition.  
Paradise lost to the soundless blanket  
of the clearest thought,  
of the loneliest mind.
