Secret Language
---------------

Night in bed,  
eyes closed, ears open,  
listening to the secret life outside my window.  
The liturgy of the nocturnal.  
Sounds and rhythms of  
swift-footed crickets  
giving testimony to the trees that overlook  
the native church like great archways  
carved of Roman hands.  

The intricate language of tiny animals  
sweeping through the night air  
unfaltering they hold me spellbound.  
How can I sleep without an interpreter?  
If only I knew what they were saying.  
I could sleep again.
