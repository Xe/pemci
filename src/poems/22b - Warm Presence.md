Warm Presence
-------------

I once wore an amulet  
that guarded against the forceps of humanity.  
It kept at bay the phalanx of wolves  
that circled me like phantoms of Gethsemane.  
Phantoms that even now  
replay their mantra like conch shells.  
Coaxing me to step out and join the earthly tribe.  
To bare my sorrow's spaciousness  
like a cottonwood's seed to the wind.  

Now I listen and watch for signals.  
To emerge a recluse squinting in ambivalence  
inscribed to tell what has been held by locks.  
It is all devised in the sheath of cable  
that connects us to Culture.  
The single, black strand that portrays us to God.  
The DNA that commands our image  
and guides our natural selection of jeans.  

Are there whispers of songs flickering  
in dark, ominous thunder?  
Is there truly a sun behind this wall of monotone clouds  
that beats a billion hammers of light?  
There are small, flat teeth that weep venom.  
There is an inviolate clemency  
in the eyes of executioners while their hands toil to kill.  
But there is no explanation for  
voyeur saints who grieve only with their eyes.  
There is only one path to follow  
when you connect your hand and eye  
and release the phantoms.  

This poem is a shadow of my heart  
and my heart the shadow of my mind,  
which is the shadow of my soul  
the shadow of God.  
God, a shadow of some unknown, unimaginable  
cluster of intelligence where galaxies  
are cellular in the universal body.  
Are the shadows connected?  
Can this vast, unknown cluster reach into this poem  
and assemble words that couple at a holy junction?  
It is the reason I write.  
Though I cannot say this junction has ever  
been found (at least by me).  

It is more apparent that some unholy hand,  
pale from darkness, reaches out and casts its sorrow.  
Some lesser shadow or phantom  
positions my hand in a lonely outpost  
to claim some misplaced illuminance.  

The phantom strains to listen for songs as they whisper.  
It coordinates with searching eyes.  
It peels skin away to touch the soft fruit.  
It welds shadows as one.  

I dreamed that I found a ransom note written in God's own hand.  
Written so small I could barely read its message, which said:  
"I have your soul, and unless you deliver--in small, unmarked  
poems--the sum of your sorrows, you will never see it alive again."  

And so I write while something unknown is curling  
around me, irresistible to my hand, yet unseen.  
More phantoms from Gethsemane who honor  
sorrow like professional confessors lost in their despair.  
I can reach sunflowers the size of  
moonbeams, but I cannot reach the sum of my sorrows.  
They elude me like ignescent stars that fall nightly  
outside my window.  

My soul must be nervous.  
The ransom is too much to pay  
even for a poet who explores the black strand of Culture.  

Years ago I found an  
impression--like snow angels--left in tall grass  
by some animal, perhaps a deer or bear.  
When I touched it I felt the warm presence of life,  
not the cold radiation of crop circles.  
This warm energy lingers only for a moment  
but when it is touched it lasts forever.  
And this is my fear: that the sum of my sorrows will last forever  
when it is touched, and even though my soul is returned  
unharmed, I will remember the cold radiation  
and not the warm presence of life.  

Now I weep when children sing  
and burrow their warm presence into my heart.  
Now I feel God adjourned by the  
source of shadows.  
Now I feel the pull of a bridle,  
breaking me like a wild horse turned  
suddenly submissive.  

I cannot fight the phantoms  
or control them or turn them away.  
They prod at me as if a lava stream should  
continue on into the cold night air  
and never tire of movement.  
Never cease its search for the perfect place to be a sculpture.  
An anonymous feature of the gray landscape.  

If ever I find the sum of my sorrows  
I hope it is at the bridgetower where I can see both ways  
before I cross over.  
Where I can see forgeries like a crisp mirage  
and throw off my bridle.  

I will need to be wild when I face it.  
I will need to look into its unnameable light and unravel  
all the shadows interlocked like paper dolls  
and cut from a multiverse of experience.  
To let them surround me  
and in one resounding chorus confer their epiphany so I  
can hand over the ransom and reclaim my soul.  

When all my sorrows are gathered round  
in an unbroken ring I will stare them down.  
Behind them waits a second ring,  
larger still and far more powerful.  
It is the ring of life's warm presence  
when sorrows have passed underneath the shadows' source  
and transform like the dull chrysalis  
that bears iridescent angels.
