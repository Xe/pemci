Nectar
------

Do you remember when we divided ourselves into two?  
Like cell divison of the soul we went away from our nucleus into the  
restless night of shadows and solitary hearts.  
Do you remember when we first remained outside of our soul?  
When gravity shouted us apart like wounded angels leery of mortality?  
Do you remember when we cluthced these other worlds  
gathering time and bodies like a river gahthers debris after a storm?  
Our longing for the other never diminished  
though our soul was muted by time.  

Do your rememeber when we first saw ourselves separate  
like young twins peering before a startled mirror?  
You told me that "All between us is illusion - an entrance into hunger.  
A journey into God."  
Do you remember our first reunion when our bodies collapsed  
in a single shadow drenching light from our soul?  
Our hunger destroyed, splaying time like fingers  
opening a tunnel between earth and all that is between us.  
And when we looked again we were two bodies  
arranged like feathers of a single wing.  
Do you remember me as you when our wings became footprints  
and the weight of words our terrestrial cage?  
You told me, "Never is light caged as long as we remember us."  
I remember you pure and powerful like a lightening flash;  
a solar breath given by God to remind me  
that your beauty unites us.  
From earth's oblivion to the trenchant heights of far-flung stars  
your beauty unites us as the faithful nectar of our soul.
