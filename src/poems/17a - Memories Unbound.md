Memories Unbound
----------------

I have this memory of laying atop  
a scaffold of tree limbs  
staring out to the black, summer blanket  
that warms the night air.  
I can smell cedar burning in the distance  
and hear muted voices praying in song and drum.  
I cannot lift my body or turn my head.  
I am conscious of bone and muscle  
but they are not conscious of me.  
They are dreaming while I am caught  
in a web of exemptible time.  

My mind is restless to move on.  
To leave this starlit grave site and dance with  
my people around huge fires crackling with nervous light.  
To join hand with hand to the rhythm of drums  
pounding their soft thunder  
in monotone commandments to live.  

I can only stare up at the sky  
watching, listening, waiting  
for something to come and set me free  
from this mournful site.  
To gather me up in arms of mercy  
into the oblivion of Heaven's pod.  
I listen for the sound of my breath  
but only the music of my people can be heard.  
I look for the movement of my hands  
but only wisps of clouds and crescent light move  
against raven's wings.  

Sometimes when this memory peeks through  
my skin it purges the shoreward view.  
It imposes on the known predicament  
with a turbulent bliss that bleeds defiance to the order.  
There is certain danger in the heritable ways  
of my people who send me the chatoyant skin  
humbled and circumscribed.  
My white appetite leached of earthly rations.  
Misplaced to the darshan of the devil,  
the very same that maneuvered my people to reservations--  
the ward of the damned.  
(At least I have no memories of a reservation).  

Perhaps it is better to lay upon this mattress of sticks  
with my wardrobe of feathers and skins  
chanting in the wind.  
Perhaps it would be better still  
to be set atop the cry shed and burned  
so prodigal memories would have  
no home to return to.  

I have this memory of escaping the pale hand  
of my master that feeds me scraps of lies and moldy bread.  
My skin yearns for lightness,  
but it is the rope that obliges.  

I have this memory of holding yellow fingers,  
large and round, dripping with ancient legacies.  
Of seeing the rounded belly of Buddha  
smiling underneath a pastoral face  
in temples that lean against a tempest sky.  

I have this memory of dreaming to fly.  
Stretching out wings that are newly attached  
with string-like permanence  
only to fall in the blunted arms of obscurity.  

I have this memory of seeing my face in a mirror  
that reflects a stranger's mind and soul.  
Knowing it to be mine, I looked away  
afraid it would become me alone.  
I am patchwork memories searching for a nucleus.  
I am lost words echoing in still canyons.  
I am a light wave that found itself  
darting to earth unsheathed seeking cover  
in human skin.
