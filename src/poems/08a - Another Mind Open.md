Another Mind Open
-----------------

There was a fire where smoke gathered   
and danced like rivers without gravity  
to the rattle of drums.  

Sometimes I would look inside the smoke  
but it curled away and covered itself  
with a cloak so opaque I could only cry.  
It became the mask of its consumption.  
The dream of its new life.  
The victorious skin always changing  
yet everlasting.  

There was a fire last night   
that proclaimed news of a newer testament  
that drinks tears, lies, vile words, even  
the deep fears that linger underneath the turncoat.  

I usually lurch away when it calls.  
To me, it burns too cold  
like a skinwalker lost in a body   
devoured by time.  
Sometimes I would dream it alive  
and it would blaze -- vibrant sun --  
more durable than a grave.  

In times of stillness   
it would speak like a codicil of some lidless dream  
that words could not preserve.  
"The time has come to lift your gaze   
from the fire's brightness  
and cast shadows of your own."  
The words would echo into oblivion  
like stars lost in the swell of the sun's awakening.  

In these flames I see my  
consumption fit and proper.  
In its smoke  
I am stored away like so many jars  
in a broom closet.  
Waiting to flee.  
Drawing my feet to oppose the floor.  
Struggling to reach the door inside these jars   
of sealed air.  

Stories escape the writer's hand  
and pursue me as though I alone held their vigil.  
Their very soul.  
When indeed these stories have never been told.  
They have never found words  
to hold though they ceaselessly try.  

Fires blind nature.  
They invest their life in her death.  
But the end is always beginning   
toward another end.  
And the dreams of the untold  
are always pursuing another mouth,  
another hand,  
another mind open.  

Sometimes I look to the errant expression of hope,   
and ask it to bring its flames deeper into my heart.  
To burn a clear sense of purpose.  
To burn away the fool's crevice   
and enshroud me in its skin of smoke.  

Sometimes I offer myself to these flames  
and know they listen.  
Devising my world.   
Reality coalesces around their finery  
like a tower of glass enclothes a shell of steel.  

Sometimes I feel the flames send me  
words, notes, tones.   
Enchantment.  
Products of another kind.  
Tiny crucibles of earth that burn so brightly  
they can blind the sun's creatures of whimsy.  

And sometimes, without even thinking,  
I peek into these flames   
when the smoke peels away for an instant.  
There, behind the mask,  
is my future.  
Our future.  
The future.  
The present in another world.  
Calling out for another mouth,  
another hand,  
another mind open.
