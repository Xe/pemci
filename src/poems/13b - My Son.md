My Son
------

My son is two.  
I watch him walk  
like a drunken prince.  
With his body bare I can see  
his soul better.  
His shoulder blades  
gesture like vestiges of wings.  
His features stenciled upon pale flesh  
by hands that have been before me.  

He so wants to be like me.  
His every movement like a dusty mirror  
or awkward shadow of a bird in flight.  
Every sound an echo heard.  
Every cell pregnant with my urges.  
But my urge is to be like him.  
To return to childhood's safe embrace  
and certain honor.  

If I return to this place  
I hope my eyes will look again upon his face  
even until his blades are wings once more.  
Until I have circled his creaturehood  
and know every hidden cleft  
where I have left my print indelible  
unable to be consumed.  
Until all that he is  
is in me and our hands are clasped, forged,  
entwined, in voiceless celebration.  

Until we are alone like two leaves shimmering  
high above a treeless landscape  
never to land.
