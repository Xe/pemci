Circle
------

I have found the ancient mirror  
that leads me.  
I have seen its ruthless eyes  
that always stare,  
burrowing their way to the crown I wear.  
I have sensed the holy fire  
like a blazing cocoon  
that offers no judgments  
amidst its power strewn.  
I have felt the innocent light.  
Of clarity in flight over native land  
where we are birthed apart  
from one command.  

I have touched the gentle eye  
that outlasts me.  
The huge patience upon my brow.  
I have offered all my earthly wisdom  
for the symptoms of its tongue;  
to drop its seeds into the fields that I plow.  
I have seen destiny's path  
gathering its flock  
for the journey of endless spaces.  
I have watched futures fall with eyelids closed  
and the gnawing tears of torn places.  
I have seen the Tribe of Light  
return the clock to the black pocket   
where all divisions occur.  
Where weeds secure the humble land  
of fires unlit, yet pure.  

I have heard the masters of masters speak   
to every cell of my body;  
cutting new pathways in flesh  
like fear's executioner.  
I have watched the galaxies twirl  
like star wheels that spiral to the thought   
of a holy vision.  
I have felt my spirit follow  
the one sound that is free.  

I have vanished before.  
I have taken this body to an inner place  
where none can see.  
Only feelings can hear the sound of this space.  
This sacred place alone  
has brought me here to recover the thread.  
To see the weaving dance that calls my name   
in a thousand sounds.  
That draws my spirit  
in a single, perfectly round,   
circle.
