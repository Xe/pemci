Soul's Photograph
-----------------

Who will find me  
in the morning after  
the winds rush over the barren body  
that once held me like a tree a leaf?  
Who will find me  
when mercy, tired of smiling,  
finally frowns in deep furrows of ancient skin?  

Who will find me?  
Will it be you?  
Perhaps it will be a cold morning  
with fresh prints of snow  
and children laughing as they  
lay down in the arms of angels.  
Perhaps it will be a warm evening  
when crickets play their music  
to the stillness of waiting stars.  
Perhaps it will be the light  
that draws me away  
or some sweet surrender that captures me  
in its golden nets.  

Who will find me  
when I have left and cast  
my line in new waters trickling   
so near this ocean of sand?  
Listen for me when I'm gone.  
Listen for me in poems  
that were formed with lips mindful of you.  
You who will outlast me.  
Who linger in the courage I could not find.  
You can see me  
in these words.  
They are the lasting image.
