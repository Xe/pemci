Missing
-------

Facing another evening without you  
I am torn from myself  
in movements of clouds,   
movements of earth spinning  
like the sure movement of lava as it rolls to sea.  
Yet when I arrive from my dream  
you are still gone from me  
23 footsteps away;  
a bouquet of the abyss.  

When I look to the east I think of you  
softly waiting for me  
to chisel you from the matrix  
with smooth hammer strokes  
from my hands.  
Freed of barren, untouched shoulders,  
you can open your eyes again  
flashing the iridescent animals,   
valiant vibrations of your rich spirit.  

Your picture is the centerpiece of my table  
I stare at you in candlelight,  
the windows behind, black in their immensity,  
only enlarge you.  
Making you more of what I miss.  

At night I go among your body  
to feel the presence of your heart beating  
something golden   
spun from another world.  
You can feel me when this is done  
though I am invisible in all ways to you, but one.  
A reflection in the mirror.  
Beneath your eyes  
you see me dancing away the body.  
Dancing away the mind.  
Dancing away the incarnations   
of my absence.
