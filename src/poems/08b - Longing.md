Longing
-------

Longing, when the eyelids open   
upon the deepest stimulus held by your lips  
and the amorous kiss becomes my orbit.  

I ache and long to have you with me  
so close our skin would melt together  
like two candle wicks sharing wax.  
I only know that what is of soul  
is of longing and ache.  
It delivers me to the edge,  
the precipice where I look down  
and see myself inextinguishable,  
longing to be consumed by you.  

And in that glittering place  
let me stretch with your heart   
at full speed, blind and intent.  
Let me dwell in you  
until I am so familiar with our union  
that it becomes part of my eyes.  
With memory full,  
we can walk home,  
hand-in-hand,   
in the permanence of longing.  

So much a part of the other  
that the other does not exist.
