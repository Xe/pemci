Separate Being
--------------

Waking this morning,  
I remember you.  
We were together last night  
only a thin sheet of glass between us.  
Your name was not clear.  
I think I would recognize its sound,  
but my lips are numb  
and my tongue listless from the  
climb to your mouth.  
Your face was blurred as well,  
yet, like a distant god  
you took your heart and hand  
and there arose within me  
a separate being.  

I think you were lonely once.  
Your only desire, to be understood,  
turned away by some vast shade  
drawn by a wisdom  
you had forgotten.  
So you sang your songs  
in quiet summons to God  
hoping their ripples would return and gather you up.  
Continue you.  
Brighten your veins  
and bring you the unquenchable  
kiss of my soul.  

Drunken by a lonely name  
you stagger forward  
into my nights, into my dreams,  
and now into my waking.  
If I try to forget you  
you will precede my now.  
I would feel your loss  
though I can't say your name  
or remember your face.  
I would awaken some morning  
and long to feel your skin upon mine  
knowing not why.  
Feeling the burn of our fire  
so clearly that names and faces  
bear no meaning  
like a candle flicking its light to the  
noonday sun.
