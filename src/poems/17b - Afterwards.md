Afterwards
----------

I've set loose the guards that stand before my door.  
I've let cells collide in suicide until they take me.  
If there were stories left to tell I would hear them.  

Behind the waterfalls of channeled panic  
spilling their prideful progeny I can stay hidden in the noise.  
Being invisible has its cameo rewards.  
It also keeps visible the durable lifeform  
murmuring beneath the wickedness.  
This is truly the only creature I care to know,  
with luminous ways of sweet generosity that suffers  
in the untelling universe of the unlistening ear.  

When I am found out-after I am gone-by a stranger's  
heart whose drill bit is not dulled by impersonation,  
I will open eyes, peel away skin, awaken the heart's coma.  
I will set aside the costumed figure and redress the host  
so its image can be seen in mirrors I set forth  
with words bugged by God.  
When these words are spoken,  
another ear is listening on the other side  
beaming understanding like lasers their neutral light.  

The common grave of courage holds us all  
in the portal of singularity,  
the God-trail of rebeginning.  

Somehow, so seldom, words and images  
thrust their meaning into heaven and conquer time.  
But when they do,  
they become the abracadabra of the sacred moment.  
The pantomime of the public's deepest longing.  

Afterwards, the improbable eyelid glances open,  
the skin folds away,  
and the heroic eye awakens and remains alert.  
Afterwards, the words eat the flesh and leave behind  
the indigestible bitterness.  
The emotional corpse shed,  
an insoluble loneliness.  
The cast of separation.
