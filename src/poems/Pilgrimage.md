Pilgrimage
----------

When I heard your voice for the first time,  
some ember that had outwitted time  
became a fire and I knew your heart  
as my own.  
And I had an image, indelible as  
the ink of India,  
of a footbridge there peasants cross over  
in pilgrimage to some great and holy spirit.  
And I turned to you,  
knowing you had waited  
for the sound of a heartbeat  
so familiar it revealed your own,  
and I said, "Let me in  
so I may be fitted to your heart."  
And you, the open vessel of all I hold dear,  
smiled upon this unbidden peasant  
and took me in.
