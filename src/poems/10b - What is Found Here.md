What is Found Here
------------------

What is found here  
can never be formed of words.  
Pure forces that mingle uncompared.  
Like dreams unspoken when first awoken  
by a sad light.  

What is found here  
can limp with one foot on the curb  
and the other on the pavement  
in some uneven gait  
waiting to be hidden in laughter.  

What is found here   
can open the swift drifting of curtains  
held in mountain winds  
when long shadows tumble across like juries  
of the night.  

What is found here  
can always be held in glistening eyes.  
Turned by silence's tool of patience.  
Like feelings harbored for so long  
the starward view has been lost.
