Forever
-------

Memory, like a root in darkness,  
piercing light with its stem  
has found me.  
Ordering my world  
like architecture of feelings  
bound to you,   
held for you as shields of hope.  
In the dispersion of love,  
identical throbbing  
has been our call  
answered in the sweetest caress  
two can share.  
And you wonder if ecstasy will diminish us  
like rain the sun or  
wind the calm.  
When we know one another  
in the deepest channel of our hearts  
we can only utter one word   
cast from this stone's mind: forever.  
Forever.  

When winter calls my name  
in the highest desert of light,  
I will not despair because I know you   
in the deepest channel of my heart  
where I understand the word, forever.  
Instantly healed by your caressing lips  
that unmasks all that has tortured me.  
The panting of mouths   
tired but astir in passion's flame  
can only cease when I have entered you  
forever.  
I carry you in this flame,  
emerald-colored from my dreams of you  
beneath the trees within  
where your beauty consumed the sun  
and snared my soul so completely.  
I cannot truly know you apart  
from a throne.  

Spirits made to shine beyond the din  
of boorish poets  
that strike flint below water and cry without passion.  
I have known you forever  
in lonely streets  
and the thundered plain.  
In wilted villages and cool mountain terraces.  
I have watched all of you  
torn open to me speaking like a river  
that moves on forever.  
And I have waited  
like the greedy mouth of an ocean  
drawing you nearer to my lips  
so I can know you forever  
as you empty into me abandoned of all fear.
