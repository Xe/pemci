Awake and Waiting
-----------------

Child-like universe emerging from darkness,  
you belong to others not I.  
My home is elsewhere  
beyond the sky  
where light pollinates the fragile borders  
and gathers the husk.  
In the quiet of the desert floor  
my shell lingers in the pallid dusk  
of a starved garden.  
What holds me to this wasteland  
when others clamor for shadows  
and resist the vital waters?  
Where the ripening magnet  
holds us blind.  

Far away,  
kindling the presence of a timeless world  
hunting for memories of a radiant love;  
wingless creatures  
tune their hearts to the key of silence.  
It is there I am waiting.  
Alone.  

O' Paradise shore  
give me the heart to bear.  
Give me the lamp that sings at night.  
Give me the wings to strive against wind.  
Give me the smile to translate life into light.  

Time obliterates the human moment.  
No one is absolved  
while beauty burns to charred ash  
too frail to last  
too secret to call.  
I will see clearly again  
past lives coarsened by time's reign.  
My light will retake its wings;  
its evergreen roots will embrace the sane earth  
once again.  
And this tiny fragment,  
spinning in silence among giant orbs unseen  
will resolve my soul and help me find   
the one heart awake and waiting.
