Compassion
----------

Angels must be confused by war.  
Both sides praying for protection,  
yet someone always gets hurt.  
Someone dies.  
Someone cries so deep   
they lose their watery state.  

Angels must be confused by war.  
Who can they help?  
Who can they clarify?  
Whose mercy do they cast to the merciless?  
No modest scream can be heard.  
No stainless pain can be felt.  
All is clear to angels  
except in war.  

When I awoke to this truth  
it was from a dream I had last night.  
I saw two angels conversing in a field  
of children's spirits rising  
like silver smoke.  
The angels were fighting among themselves  
about which side was right  
and which was wrong.  
Who started the conflict?  

Suddenly, the angels stilled themselves   
like a stalled pendulum,  
and they shed their compassion   
to the rising smoke  
of souls who bore the watermark of war.  
They turned to me with those eyes  
from God's library,  
and all the pieces fallen   
were raised in unison,  
coupled like the breath   
of flames in a holy furnace.  

Nothing in war comes to destruction,   
but the illusion of separateness.  
I heard this spoken so clearly I could only   
write it down like a forged signature.  
I remember the compassion,  
mountainous, proportioned for the universe.  
I think a tiny fleck still sticks to me  
like gossamer threads   
from a spider's web.  

And now, when I think of war,  
I flick these threads to the entire universe,  
hoping they stick on others  
as they did me.  
Knitting angels and animals  
to the filamental grace of compassion.  
The reticulum of our skyward home.
