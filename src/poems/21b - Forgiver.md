Forgiver
--------

Last night we talked for hours.  
You cried in unstoppable sorrow,  
while I felt a presence carve itself into me  
source and savior of your dragging earth.  
You feel so deeply, your mind barely visible  
staring ahead to what the heart already knows.  
I see the distance you must heal.  
I know your pacing heart bounded by corners  
that have been rounded and smoothed  
like a polished stone from endless waves.  
For all I know you are me in another body,  
slots where spirits reach in to throw the light  
interpreting dreams.  
Prowling for crowns.  

Are there ways to find your heart  
I haven't found?  
You, I will swallow without tasting first.  
I don't care the color.  
Nothing could warn me away.  
Nothing could diminish my love.  
And only if I utterly failed  
in kinship would you banish me.  

Last night, I know I was forgiven.  
You gave me that gift unknowing.  
I asked for forgiveness  
and you said it was unneeded;  
time shuffled everything anew and it was its own  
forgiver.  

But I know everything not there  
was felt by you and transformed.  
It was given a new life, though inconspicuous,  
it wove us together to a simple, white stone  
lying on the ground that marks a spot of sorrow.  
Beneath, our union, hallowed of tiny bones  
beseech us to forgive ourselves  
and lean upon our shoulders  
in memory of love, not loss.  

Blame settles on no one;  
mysterious, it moves in the calculus  
of God's plan as though no one thought  
to refigure the numbers three to two to one.  
The shape stays below the stone.  
We walk away,  
knowing it will resettle  
in our limbs  
in our bones  
in our hearts  
in our minds  
in our soul.
