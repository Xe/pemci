Song of Whales
--------------

Your voice lingers when it speaks   
like rippling heat over desert floor.  
It draws my heart and I find myself   
leaning toward its source  
as though I know it will take me   
where you always are.  
It draws me near to your breath -- the spiracle that   
holds the words of home.  
It draws me to the blanket you hold   
around your soul you so willingly share.  

If you were to dive below the waters   
where the whales sing their songs  
into the gathering of deep currents   
that pull our courage along,  
channels that flow free of worldly levels,   
you would find me there.  
Listening to the voice I hear in you.  
Feeding my heart in the waters of deep blindness   
where currents flow  
mindful of you and your spirited ways.  

Sometimes I listen so perfectly   
I hear your soft breath forming words  
before they are found by you.   
Before you can bring them from   
the deep blindness to your heart.  

I wish I could take your hand   
and let it hold my heart  
so you could see what I know of you.  
So you could know   
where we live where we always are.  
And you could pull your blanket of words   
around us and I could simply listen  
to your voice   
that honors words   
like the songs of whales.
