Folded Things
-------------

So often I have bared my soul  
and spread its wealth around me  
relishing its golden hue.  
So often there were poems, paintings, music  
that flowed in one stream  
that held messages that only I could hear.  
But I would take them and  
fold them into something I hoped others  
would also hear.  
So often the folded thing  
would resonate in solitude  
yet escape the touch of another.  
So often I would look to you  
and hope that you would see and hear  
what I have seen and heard.  
But the message would waver  
and disappear like smoke ascending into air.  
So often I have wondered  
why there is no one to share these folded things;  
as if only I could understand  
their solitude.  
As if only I could feel their heartbeat  
beneath the emptiness in which they sleep.  

If all of these are summed  
and divided by love  
you would know them as your own children.  
You would see them as they are.  
Yet they are mysteries viewed  
as mere elements of time.  
So often I have taken these folded things  
and left them behind  
for others to unfold and wear.  
And when I look back  
at their clothing they appear like stars  
against the persistent blackness.  
Like comets dancing to the forbidden music  
of another world.  
Calling so softly... when it is heard,  
the folded things unfold their beauty  
and nothing is forbidden again.
