A Fire For You
--------------

On this, the shortest day of the year,  
I have journeyed to the Great Plains   
to build a fire for you.  

The night air is cold like a cellar  
cut from ancient stones.  
But I found some wood among the deserted plains   
buried under the grasses and dirt,  
hidden away like leaves   
that had become the soil.  
After I cleaned the wood by hand -- its dirt beneath   
my nails and the fabric of my cloth   
I sent a flame   
combusted by the mere thought of you.  
And the wood became fire.  

There were hermit stars that gathered   
overhead to keep me company.  
Your spirit was there as well   
amidst the fire's flames.  
We laughed at the deep meaning of the sky   
and its spacious ways.  
Marveling at the flat mirror of the plain  
that sends so little skyward,  
like the hearts of children denied   
a certain kind of love.  

You played with spirits   
when you were young among these fields.  
You didn't know their names then.  
I was one.  
Even without a name, or body,  
I watched your gaze, unrelenting to the things   
that beat between the   
two mirrors of the sky and plain.  

I believe it was here also   
that you learned to speak with God.  
Not in so many words as you're now accustomed,  
but I'm certain that God listened to your life  
and gathered around your fire   
for warmth and meaning.  
In the deserted plains he found you set apart  
from all things missing.  

Dear spirit, I have held this vigil for so long,  
tending fires whose purpose I have forgotten.  
I think warmth was one.   
Perhaps light was another.  
Perhaps hope was the strongest of these.  

If ever I find you around my fire,   
built by hands  
that know your final skin,  
between the sheets of the sky and plain,  
I will remember its purpose.  
In barren fields   
that have long been deserted by the hand of man  
I will remember.   
In the deepest eye of you  
I will remember.  
In the longest night of you  
I will remember.  

On this, the shortest day of the year,  
I have journeyed to the Great Plains   
to build a fire for you.
