Nothing Matters
---------------

Space is curved  
so no elevator can slither to its stars.  
Time is a spindle of the present  
that spins the past and future away.  
Energy is an imperishable force  
so permanence can be felt.  
Matter flings itself to the universe,  
perfectly pitiless in its betrayal of soul.  

You can only take away  
what has been given you.  

Have you not called the ravens the foulest of birds?  
Is their matter and energy so different than ours?  
Are we not under the same sky?  
Is their blood not red?  
Their mouth pink, too?  

Molten thoughts, so hot they fuse space and time,  
sing their prophecies of discontent.  
Listen to their songs in the channels of air  
that curl overhead like temporary tattoos  
of light's shimmering ways.  

Am I merely a witness of the betrayal?  
Where are you who are cast to see?  
How have you been hidden from me?  
Is there a splinter that carries you to the whole?  

If I could speak your names I would call you to my side  
and take your hands so gentle you would not see me,  
feeling only the warm passage of time  
and the tremor of your spine moving you to weep.  

Space is curved so I must bend.  
Time is a spindle so I must resolve its center.  
Energy, an imperishable force I must ride.  
And matter, so pitiless I refuse to be betrayed.  

So I stand naked to the coldest wind  
and ask it to carve out an island in my soul  
in honor of you who stand beside me in silence.  
Lonely, I live on this island assured of one thing:  
that of space, time, energy, and matter; nothing matters.  
Yet when I think of you in the cobwebbed corner,  
hoveled without wings  
like a seed planted beneath a dead tree stump,  
I know you are watching  
with new galaxies wild in your breast.  
I know you are listening  
to the lidded screams smiling their awkward trust.  
All I ask of you is to throw me a rope sometimes  
so I can feel the permanence of your heart.  
It's all I need in the face of nothing matters.
