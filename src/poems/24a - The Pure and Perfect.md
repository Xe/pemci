The Pure and Perfect
--------------------

Someday the messengers will arrive  
with stories of a nocturnal sun  
despondent, burning implacably  
in the deepest shade of a thousand shadows.  
They will tell you of the  
serene indifference of God.  
They will draw you by the hand  
through bruised alleyways  
and prove the desperation of man  
rejected from the beauty of an unearthly realm.  
The news will arrive  
as a tribute to the death of oracles.  
Sparing words of purpose  
the messengers will announce the  
cold fury of realism's cave.  

Someday, the messengers will send their thoughts  
through books that have no pulse.  
You will be accused of weakness  
that drowns you in servitude.  
A queer rivalry will beset you  
and your life will crawl like an awkward beast  
that has no home.  

And you, my dearest friends,  
who are truth -- who were all along,  
will renew your devotion  
to a powerful image in a distant mirror.  
You will listen to these stories  
and tear at your silent heart  
with animal claws that are dulled  
by the stone doors of time.  
Where the unattested is confirmed  
your vestige-soul is stored.  
It will strengthen you  
and cradle you in the light  
of your own vision,  
which will be hurled like lightening  
through twilight's dull corridor.  

The messengers will cry  
at the sound of your rejection.  
They will scream: "Do you want to be a  
lowly servant and lonely saint?"  

Mutants of the light  
are always tested with doubts  
of a swollen isolation  
and the promise of truth's betrayal.  
Listen without hearing.  
Judge without pardon.  
The grand parasite of falsehood  
will prevail if you believe only your beliefs.  

Someday, when all is clear to you --  
when the winds have lifted all veils  
and the golden auberge is the locus  
of our souls --  
you will be tested no more.  
You will have reached destiny's lodge  
and the toilsome replica of God  
is jettisoned for the pure and perfect.
