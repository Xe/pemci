Wishing Light
-------------

Sun walks the roof of the sky  
with a turtle's patience.  
Circling endlessly amidst the black passage  
of arrival and retreat.  
Moon can shape shift  
and puncture the confidant darkness.  
The weaker sister of sun  
it bleeds light even as it dwindles  
to a fissure of fluorescence.  
Black sky like a monk's hood draped  
over stars with squinted eyes.  
Stewards lost,  
exiled to overspread  
the dark lair of the zodiac.  
This silent outback where  
light is uprooted and cast aside  
beats like a tired clock uneven.  
It dreams of sunlight passing so  
it can follow like a parasite.  
Tired of meandering in absence it  
wants to live the speed of light and feel its directness.  
Wishing to stay alive in light years  
and not some recumbent eternity.  
Desiring the sharp pain of life  
to the dull, numbing outskirts of ancient space.

Darkness follows light like a tireless  
wind that pours over tumbleweeds.  
But it always seems to outlast the people  
if not the light.
