Easy to Find
------------

I have often looked inside my drawers  
without knowing why.  
Something called out.  
Seek me and you shall find,  
but when I obey I'm confounded by memory's fleeting ways.  
Hands immerse and return awkwardly empty  
like a runaway child  
when no one came after them.  

I know there is something I seek  
that hides from me so I can't think about what I lack.  
It is, however, and this is the point, too damn powerful  
to be silent and still.  
Besides, I know I lack it because I miss it.  

I miss it.  
Whatever "it" is.  
Whatever I need it to be it is not that.  
It can never be anything but what it is.  
And so I search in drawers and closets absent of why,  
driven like a machine whose switch has been thrown  
just because it can.  

I miss it.  
I wish it could find me.  
Maybe I need to stay put long enough for it to do so.  
Now there's a switch.  
Let the powerful "it" seek me out.  
But for how long must I wait?  
And how will I recognize it should it find me?  

There must be names for this condition that end in phobia.  
Damn, I hate that suffix.  

It all starts with a sense of wonder and ends in a sense of emptiness.  
God, I wish you could find me here.  
I'll tuck myself in a little drawer right out in the open.  
I won't bury myself under incidentals.  
I'll be right on top.  
Easy to find.  
Do you need me for anything?  
I hope so because I need you for everything.
