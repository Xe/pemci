Dream Wanderer
--------------

Intoxicated with children's thoughts  
I wonder,  
why are souls so deep and men so blind?  
How can souls be eclipsed  
by such tiny minds?  
Do we love the damp passageways of Hell?  
Where every drop of pale water  
that falls from the cavern walls  
is unwashed music etched in silence...  

My favored dreams have disappeared  
astride the backs of eagles.  
With wings sweeping downward, lifting upward,  
they are carried away like finespun, elegant seeds  
on a crystalline wind.  
Without them  
I am divinely barren  
like an empty vessel denied its purpose.  
I can only stare into the silence  
ever listening for heaven's murmur.  
Knowing that behind the darkening mist  
angels are building shelters for human innocence.  
Shelters torn from something dark  
and gravely wounded.  
Havens resistant to all disease.  

I thought I was endowed  
with a promised beauty  
that would free the neglected dreams of a demigod.  
That would untie their feeble knots  
and release them into light's caress.  
But the glorious reins  
that had once been mine,  
tattered and stained with blood,  
have slipped from my hands in disuse  
as a web abandoned to a ghostly wind.  
I can still reach them.  
I can feel their shadow across my hands.  
Their power, like an electric storm  
wandering aimlessly without fuel,  
soon to be exhausted.  

This piece of paper  
is torn from something dark  
and gravely wounded.  


It is the mirror I hold up to the blackened sky.  
A devious sacrifice.  
Leaping from star to star  
my eyes weave a constellation.  
My thoughts in search of the endless motherload.  
My heart listening for the sound  
of unstained children dreaming.  

The dream wanderer looks back at me.  
Calls my name in a whispered voice.  
Beckons me with an outstretched wing.  

"Fly! Your favored dreams await you!"  

The voice boomed like thunder swearing.  
My wings trembled with forbidden power  
as they searched the wind's current  
for signs of release.  
Currents that would carry me  
to the high branches of trees  
suckling the sun in fields beyond my kingdom.  

In a moment's interlude  
I unfolded my wings and vaulted skyward,  
into the blue vestibule.  
Sheer speed.  
Rivers beneath were brown veins  
swollen on earth's legs,  
or savage cuts that bled green.  
The sun sliced holes in the clouds  
with tender spears of crimson light.  
The moon was rising in the eastern sky-  
an oyster shell  
pitted by time.  
Lonely winds would rush by  
searching for an outpost of stillness.  
The earthen dungeon  
peered up at me with contempt  
like a nursemaid relieved of her duty.  

I forgot the ground.  
I canceled gravity.  
Balanced against aboriginal hopes and fears  
I became the shaman who dances  
in the spirit waters of ancestors  
plucking words and meanings from the cumbrous air.  

I thought only of the dream wanderer...  
the holy wind that rekindles  
my exquisite longing for raw truth.  

To seize it like medicine  
in a sleepless fever hoping to be healed.  
The halcyon spire!  
The dusty places of purity.  

These wings are torn  
from something dark and gravely wounded.  
They carry me to my favored dreams  
and choke the inertia of indifference dead.  
Their strength is perfectly matched  
to my destination.  
One more mile beyond these trees,  
I would fall like a fumbled star  
into the moat of a starving world.  

My favored dreams will wander again.  
In time they will soar to trees of a richer kingdom.  
My wings will again follow their flight,  
track their heartbeat  
and build a quilt of a thousand dreams intermingled.  
One more turn of the infinite circle.  
The dream slate revivified.  
Navigable-  
even in the murky waters  
and cloudy skies of the itinerant traveler.  
The dream wanderer reveals  
(with a flip of the hourglass of heaven),  
as above  
so below.  
Create your world and let it go forward  
entrusted to the one that is all.  
The leavening will prevail.  
It is the lesson I learned  
with my wings outstretched beneath  
the glaring sky.  
It is the rawness I seek  
untouched by another's polish.
