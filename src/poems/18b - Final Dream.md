Final Dream
-----------

Strike the flint that burns  
a lonely world  
and opens blessed lovers  
to the golden grave of earth's flame.  

Listen to the incantation  
of raindrops as they pass from gray clouds  
to our mother's doorstep.  
Dreams of miracles yet to come  
harbor in their watery husks.  

Stand before this cage  
splashed with beauty and stealth  
and arranged with locks that have grown frail.  
A simple breath  
and all life is joined in the frontier.  

Here is the masterpiece of creation  
that has emerged from the unknown  
in the depths of a silent Heart.  
Here is the laughter sought  
among rulers of death.  
Here are the brilliant colors of rainbows  
among the spilling reds that purge our flock.  
Here is the hope of forever  
among stone markers that stare through eyelids  
released of time.  
Here are the songs of endless voices  
among the heartless dance of invisible power.  

There is an evening bell that chimes  
a melody so pure  
even mountains weep  
and angels lean to listen.  
There is a murmur of hope that sweeps  
aside the downcast eyes of hungry souls.  

It is the fragrance of God  
writing poems upon the deep blue sky  
with pin-pricks of light and a sleepless moon.  
It is the calling to souls  
lost in the forest of a single world  
to be cast, forged, and made ready  
for the final dream.
