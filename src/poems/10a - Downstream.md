Downstream
----------

Open me.  
Take me from here to there.  
Let the wind blow   
my hair and the earth's skin touch me.  

Open me like broken bottles  
that bear no drink  
yet think themselves worthy of the trash man.  
Open me to the clans from which I sprout.  
Are they colors separated, cast apart  
like memories of drunkenness?  
Open me to Africa, Asia, America, Australia.  
Open me like a package  
of mystery left on your doorstep  
in the sweetness of laughter.  

Open me to the crudely made lens of love  
that screams to be of human hands  
and lips.  
Open me to the glance  
that comforts strangers like the tender overture  
of a mourning dove.  

Is the wisdom of horses mine  
to harness?  
Is the muscle of wolves  
lawless or the healer of sheep?  
Is the black opal of the eye  
the missing link we all seek?  

Open me to the authors of this beaten path  
and let them flavor it anew.  
Bring them flecks of the rumored and rotten  
slum that waits downstream.  
Show them the waste of their watch.  
The shallow virility that exterminates.  
The ignominy that exceeds examination.  

Open me to the idols of the idle.  
Let me stare open mouthed at the herdsmen  
who turn innocence into fear.  
Is the plan of the sniper to uncivilize  
the nerveless patch of skin  
that grows unyielding to pain?  

Open me to the stains  
of this land that original sin cannot explain.  
Let these symptoms go  
like dead, yellow leaves fumbling  
in swift, guiltless currents downstream.  

Downstream where the slum   
lies in waiting.  
Downstream where the idols' headstones  
are half-buried in muddy rain.  
Downstream where animal tracks   
are never seen.  
Downstream where  
the lens of love is cleaned with red tissue.  
Downstream where the herdsmen  
herd their flock and beat the drums  
promising a new river that never comes.  

Downstream there lives   
a part of me that is sealed like a paper envelope   
with thick tape.  
It watches the river like the underside of a bridge  
waiting to fall if the seal is broken.  
To plunge into the current when I am opened  
by some unforgiving hand unseen.  
To be drawn downstream  
in the gravity of a thousand minds   
who simply lost their way.  
A thousand minds that twisted the river  
away from earth's sweetness  
into the mine shaft of men's greed.  

So it must be.  
So it must be.  

Open me to the kindness  
of a child's delicate hand when it reaches out to be held.  
Let it comfort me  
when my bridge falls and the swift, guiltless currents  
pull me downstream  
where all things forgiven are lost.  
Where all things lost are forgiven.
