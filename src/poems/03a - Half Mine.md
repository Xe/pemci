Half Mine
---------

When I see your face I know you are half mine  
separated by the utmost care to remember all of you.  
When I undress my body I see that I am half yours  
blurred by sudden flight that leaves  
the eye wondering what angels carved in their hearts  
to remind them so vividly of their home.  

When I see your beauty I know you are half mine  
never to be held in a polished mirror  
knowing the faithful hunger of our soul.  
When I watch your eyes I know they are half mine  
tracing a trajectory where sensual virtue is the very spine of us.  
When I hold your hand I know it is half mine  
wintered in kinship, it circles tenderness  
beneath the moon and well of water when the feast is done.  
When I kiss your lips I know they are half mine  
sent by God's genealogy to uncover us  
in the delicious cauldron of our united breath.  

When I hear you cry I know your loneliness is half mine  
so deep the interior that we are lost outside  
yearning to give ourselves away  
like a promise made before the asking.  
And when I look to your past I know it is half mine  
running to the choke cherry trees  
invisible to the entire universe we found ourselves  
laughing in sudden flight  
eyeing the carved initials in our hearts.  
Sparing the trees.
