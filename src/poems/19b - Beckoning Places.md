Of Beckoning Places
-------------------

Of beckoning places  
I have never felt more lost.  
Nothing invites me onward.  
Nothing compels my mouth to speak.  
In cave-like ignorance, resembling oblivion,  
I am soulless in sleep.  
Where are you, beloved?  
Do you not think I wait for you?  
Do you not understand the crystal heart?  
Its facets like mirrors for the clouds  
absent of nothing blue.  

Invincible heaven with downcast eyes  
and burning bullets of victory that peel through flesh  
like a hungry ax, why did you follow me?  
I need an equal not a slayer.  
I need a companion not a ruler.  
I need love not commandments.  

Of things forgotten  
I have never been one.  
God seems to find me even in the tumbleweed  
when winds howl  
and I become the wishbone in the hands  
of good and evil.  
Why do they seek me out?  
What purpose do I serve if I cannot become visible to you?  

You know, when they put animals to sleep  
children wait outside  
as the needle settles the debt of pain and age.  
The mother or father write a check and  
sign their name twice that day.  
They drop a watermark of tears.  
They smile for their children  
through clenched hearts beating  
sideways like a pendulum of time.  

And I see all of this and more in myself.  
A small animal whose debts are soon to be settled.  
Children are already appearing outside  
waiting for the smile of parents to reassure.  
The signature and watermark  
they never see.  

Of winter sanctuary I have found only you.  
Though I wait for signals to draw me from the cold  
into your fire  
I know they will come even though I fumble for my key.  
Even though my heart is beheaded.  
Even though I have only learned division.  
I remember you and the light above your door.
