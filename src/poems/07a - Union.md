Union
-----

You are not here.  
In this moment all that exists is here.  
But you are not.  
There are so many footprints   
leading to my door.  
Let us enter, they say.  
We cannot sleep in the desert  
it is too cold.  
Our tears will dry too fast.  
Our ears will hurt from the silence.  
Let us in.  
And so I gather them all up,  
swing wide my door,  
and step aside as they enter  
hoping they will lay in peace beside my fire.  

You were not among them.  
I looked everywhere for your face   
and saw only mimicry.  
The blind eye buried behind brain  
searching for your heart.   
An antenna so alert  
there is a peculiar nearness of you   
flying inside my body.  
I can hold this like a tiny bird in my hands;  
fragile, vulnerable, waiting  
for my move to decide its fate.  

You are not here.  
I wish I could reach your skin,  
remove the camouflage  
tearing it away like black paper  
held before the sun as a shield.  
Unbundle you from your other lives  
and distill you in my now.  
You are my last love,  
my final embrace of this world  
and all the others that drop their prints at my door  
are dimmed by your approaching steps.  

I can see you will be here soon.  
There is victory in my heart  
and something invisible yet massive wants to speak.  
Reminding me of you and your coming.  
Quick, I plead, give me your lips.  
Give me your womanly tenderness  
that understands everything  
so I may lose myself in you  
and forget my loss.  

If you were here, I would tell you this secret.  
But you would need to be staring up at the stars  
when I told you, held within my arms  
feeling the earth rise up beneath you like a holy bed.  
You would need our union to be your ears.
