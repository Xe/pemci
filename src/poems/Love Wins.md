Love Wins
---------

We are the offspring of parental winds,  
plotting the distance of heavens unseen.  
The deep-cast search,  
to the implicate order.  

The deep shadows conduct the epiphany.  
We decelerate to sample personhood.  
The delicate crust of illusion   
that begets our heart's intellect.  

A god chants our name  
and we are born...  
Led by a force that sees all.  
Held by a force that feels small.  

As galaxies flick their light to us  
we watch the flickering pixels,  
spellbound,  
in the mirror of mirrors.  

There is no battle here.  

Love wins...   
love.  

It is the oldest equation of Truth.  

The soul's heartbeat,  
yearning to be voiced.  
Like a match head  
seeking the emery.  

The God-spark reunited  
with the boundless.  
Beneath the fur of wolves  
a million generations of survival sway.  
We are a million generations  
on the other side of the membrane.  

The flawed walls will fall.  
A forgery of protection.  
In the rainment of light,  
untamable,  
we fly beneath  
the Creator's dream.  
In the high-beam of love  
only one thing is needed...  
Someone like you.
