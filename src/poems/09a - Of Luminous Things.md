Of Luminous Things
------------------

Of luminous things   
I have so little experience  
that I often think myself small.  
Yet when I think of you   
and your luminous ways  
my being swells with hope and prayers  
that you will permit the flames to grow.  

In mercy, we are torn apart   
into separate worlds  
to find ourselves over and over  
a thousand times aching for the other half.  
To dream of nothing but the One between us.  

Of luminous things I have squandered none  
nor have I held them to my heart and asked them  
to dissolve into me.  
Yet when I think of you, I desire only this.   
And if you disrobed your Self and watched it   
watch you, you would see me as clearly as I am.  
Not small and unworthy.  
Unafraid of fear.  
Not uncertain like empty space.  
But luminous   
like white light before the prism.  

In my thoughts I hold your heart   
sculpting away the needless  
for the essence.  
And when I find it  
I will hold it to my heart and ask it   
to dissolve into me.  
I will know of luminous things   
that hurtle through time  
bringing us the uncharted, unfathomable  
desire we have never spoken.  
Words are not curious enough to say their names.  
Only love can weep their identity,  
and I am so perfectly defenseless   
to its music.
