Listening
---------

I am listening for a sound beyond sound  
that stalks the nightland of my dreams,  
entering rooms of fossil-light  
so ancient they are swarmed by truth.  

I am listening for a sound beyond us  
that travels the spine's  
invisible ladder to the orphic library.  
Where rebel books revel in the unremitting light.  
Printed in gray, tiny words with quicksand depth  
embroidered with such care they  
render spirit a ghost, and God,  
a telescope turned backwards upon itself  
dreaming us awake.  

Never-blooming thoughts surround me  
like a regatta of crewless ships.  
I listen leopard-like,  
canting off the quarantine of bodies  
sickened by the monsoon of still hearts.  
There is certain magic  
in the heartbeat which crowds the sound I seek,  
but it is still underneath the beating I wish to go.  
Underneath the sound of all things  
huddled against the tracking dishes  
that turn their heads to the sound of stars.  

I am listening for a sound unwound,  
so vacant it stares straight with the purity to peer  
into the black madness of time  
sowing visions that oscillate in our wombs  
bearing radiant forms as the substrate of our form.  

When I look to the compass needle  
I see a blade of humility  
bent to a force waylaid like wild rain  
channeled in sewer pipes.  
Running underground  
in concrete canals that quiver,  
laughing up at us as though we were lost  
in the sky-world with no channel for our ride.  

I am listening for a sound  
in your voice,  
past the scrub terrain of your door  
where my ear is listening on the other side.  
Beneath your heart where words go awkward  
and light consumes the delicate construction of mingled lives.  
I can only listen for the sound I know is there,  
glittering in that unpronounceable, stateless state  
quarried of limbs so innocent  
they mend the flesh of hearts.
