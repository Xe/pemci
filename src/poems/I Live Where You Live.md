I Live Where You Live
---------------------

I live where you live;  
where rounded hills and flowered valleys  
settle beneath the sky,  
and skyscrapers claw against gravity.  
It may seem  
that I have left you with strange faces,  
but I live where you live.  

When you have left  
the things you cherish in your mind  
you will find what remains  
inside you,  
and it is not of gloom  
nor toilsome handiwork  
wrought of hand and brain.  

I am not God, nor some lofty spirit unseen.  
I am not the angel’s voice in the quickening night  
nor the soft whisper of your awakened dreams.  
I am present in the one place that is all places.  
I live where you live.  

When you have claimed the name of God  
you have felt shadows of our union.  
You have fathomed a mask  
that glistens a feeble photon of light  
wandering unfettered into  
the night’s industry.  

When you have taken this mask  
from your heart  
and held it to the calm night sky  
let nothing stir within you.  

Let the winds dance with forgiveness.  

Breathe the essence of me  
and let it be alive inside you  
flowing to your heart’s command.  

If you press the hand of God  
upon you there  
you can sense oneness in every eye.  

I am the sovereign within all living forms  
and I pass among you  
in the oblivion of your breath,  
and the beating of your hearts.  

In the land of war and peace  
I am the mystery of good and evil  
amid the flowering of oneness.  

I live in the corridors of a deeper unity  
where identity is One  
and personality is many.  

Near-infinite voices  
leap from the same heart  
wandering to oneness  
on the roads of time.  

No heart is separate  
from the one Heart.  
No breath is ever alone.  
Love given  
is never lost.  

I live where you live.
