Of This Place
-------------

Her heart ran   
in the wilds of deserted plains.  
Sun-etched land barren of clouds  
and singing water.  
If she listened closely   
her hand would call  
and signal its thoughts upon her brow.  
But in this place  
she could only offer her arms to the sky  
like a tree its branches  
and a flower its leaves.  

In this dusty basin,  
silence gathered like smoke  
clearing the mind of the scoundrel.  
The infidel of thoughts.  
Blots of yellow leaves and white bark  
could be seen hiding in pools of life  
surrounded by red rock spires.  
Clustered sand monuments held together  
by some other life form.  
She wasn't sure.  
Perhaps one life is the same as another  
only tilted sideways.  
Caught from underneath   
by some invisible hand that animates   
even the coldest stone of this place.  

A smile emerged and perched upon her face  
drinking the sun's clear ways.  
She could spear  
a million miles of air in a glance  
and send the window of her flesh  
into the cloudless sky.  
Upon this ocean a hawk sailed ever closer.  
She watched the silver speck  
spiral overhead dreaming through its eyes.  
Feeling the winds gild her wings   
in the softest fold of time.  
A tree of pine sent its sky roots   
deep within the air to weep its sweetness.  
She entered,   
gliding through branches  
to every needle in their factory of air.  

So strange to feel the pull of earth in flight,  
but she knew the antagonism well   
in the splendor of this place.  
She knew it had settled deep,  
lodged like permanent ink  
in the heart of her.  
Under skin, muscle, bone  
it fought the single path.  
What madness calls her away?  
What dream is stronger than this?  
What heart beats more pure?  

Of this place,  
it is so hard to know which is host   
and which is guest.  
Which is welcome, which is pest.  
Which is found and which is lost.  
Which is profit, which is cost.  

She gave her prayers  
to the skypeople and waited for a cloud --   
her signal to leave.  
She should return home  
before dusk settles in and the golden  
eyes peer out against the black code.  
In a single breath she held the ancient ways  
that never left.  
She turned them inside out  
and then outside in.   
Again and again.  
Waiting for her signals in the sky.  
If not a cloud...  
then perhaps a shooting star.  
(Besides, it was too dark for clouds anymore.)  

When the first star fell she held her breath  
afraid she would miss its spectral flight.  
She wondered with whom she shared   
its final light.  

What other eyes were heaven bound  
in that secret moment?  
Was this their signal home as well?  
And what was it they found  
buried so deep in a whisper of light  
that none can tell?  

She waited with solemn eyes  
for more stars to fall,  
to gently sweep her away  
from the magnets of this place.  
If she listened to her hand  
it would scratch a sign in the sand for another  
to take her place.  
It would touch the land  
in honor of its grace and wisdom,  
and become a tree, rock, hawk, or flower.
