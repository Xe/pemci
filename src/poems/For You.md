For You
-------

In the deepest part of me  
in the room below,  
and beneath even there  
if I let myself go,  
I find an ancient,  
unchanged yearning  
to live for you.  

Incorruptible  
as the sun faithfully desired  
it ascends all the steps  
of my heart,  
and when it stands at the landing  
baring its light  
I can only speak four words,  
I live for you.  

Restless,  
this feeling returns  
underneath where it  
waits with peculiar receptivity  
unfit for any other calling.  
So powerfully alone.  
My heart beats only one memory,  
to live for you.
