Language of Innocence
---------------------

When a river is frozen,  
underneath remains a current.  
When the sky is absent of color  
beneath the globe another world comes to light.  
When my heart is alone  
somewhere another heart beats my name  
in code that only paradise can hear.  

Is my heart deaf  
or is there no one   
who can speak the language of innocence?  
Innocence, when words  
suffer meaning and gallop away in its presence.  
I have seen it.  
Felt it.  
I have loosened its secrets in the blushing skin  
when upturned eyes witness its home  
and never turn away.  
And never turn away.  

There is this world  
of slumbering hearts and hollow love,  
but it cannot carry me to daylight.  
My craving is so different   
and it can never be turned away.
