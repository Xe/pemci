Transparent Things
------------------

There it is then, my open wound,  
eager for forgiveness.  
It comes with age like brown spots and silver hair.  
Shouldn't age bring more than different colors  
to adorn the body?  
I think it was meant to.  
It just forgot.  
Old age does that you know.  
Too many things to remember here.  
Both worlds demanding so much,  
one to learn, one to remember.  

If there was silence in these waters  
my wound would dance open  
and separate itself from all attackers.  
Even this body.  
It would look at you  
in the orphaning light, diminished of features,  
and lead you away to its place of sorrow.  
It would ask you to lie down beside it  
and wave goodbye  
to the coiled currents that tug and pull  
to separate us from ourselves.  
It would hold your hands,  
so masterful in their wisdom,  
so mindful of their glory  
that it would disappear inside.  
In the future, someone,  
a friend perhaps, would  
read your palm and notice  
a small line veering off in a ragged ambush.  
Unchained from the rest  
of your palm's symmetry.  
A lonely fragment waving goodbye  
to everything between us.  

There it is then, my prayer for you  
to close this wound  
and draw the shades around us.  
Deep, black solitude enfolding us,  
the kind found only in caves  
that have shut out light for the growing of delicate,  
transparent things.
