Spiral
------

Inside there is something gnawing  
with silken jaws and wax teeth.  
It holds me still in pureness  
like a circle whose middle is my cage.  

While you went away from me  
I was ever tightening my circle.  
A spiral cut in glass.  
A flower's bloom dropping petals.  
A winnowed ball of yarn  
spilling color.  

I see the inside of your thigh  
brilliant in its smoothness,  
and I spiral ever closer to your edge.  
Paper cut touching I burn  
bleeding without pain.  
How could I spill so easily  
without knowing why?  

When I hear your voice  
there is no quenching this ache  
to hold you.  
Like one who draws near and then forgets  
the story they came to tell,  
I circle you waiting for thread's tautness  
to draw us ever closer  
though I know not how.  

The final luxury is the kiss  
of your boundless heart.  
The final beauty so pure  
all else limps behind blissfully in your wake.  
Drawing from your shadows  
the light of saplings  
lurking on the forest floor.  

If I could unbutton you,  
take your dress down  
I would see a map of my universe.  
A phantom limb, grown from  
my body like wings sprouting from a chrysalis  
reaches for you.  
It is the hand of clarity  
desperate for your skin  
so powerfully bidden  
as though a shimmering block of light  
cut from black velvet,  
stood before me.  
And all I could do was to reach out  
and touch it,  
not knowing why,  
but utterly unafraid.
