In the Kindness of Sleep
------------------------

I visited you last night when you  
were sleeping with a child's abandon.  
Curled so casual in sheets  
inlaid by your beauty.  
I held my hand to your face  
and touched as gently  
as I know how  
so you could linger with your dreams.  
I heard soft murmurs that only angels make  
when they listen to their home.  
So I drew my hand away  
uneasy that I might wake you  
even as gentle as I was.  

But you stayed with your dreams  
and I watched as they found their way to you  
in the kindness of sleep.  
And I dreamed that I was an echo of your body  
curled beside you like a fortune hunter  
who finally found his gold.  
I nearly wept at the sound of your breath,  
but I stayed quiet as a winter lake, and bit my lip  
to ensure I wouldn't be detected.  

I didn't want to intrude  
so I set my dream aside  
and I gently pulled your hand from underneath  
the covers to hold.  
A hand whose entry into flesh  
must have been the lure that brought me here.  
And as I hold it  
I remember why I came  
to feel your pulse  
and the beating of your heart in deep slumber.  
And I remember why I came in the  
kindness of sleep...  
to hold your hand, touch your face  
and listen to the soft breathing  
of an angel,  
curled so casual in sheets  
inlaid by your beauty.
