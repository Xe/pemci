The Nature of Angels
--------------------

Midnight in the desert and all is well.  
I told myself so and so it is,  
or it is not,  
I haven't quite decided yet.  
Never mind the coyotes' howl or  
the shrinking light.  
Holiness claims my tired eyes  
as I return the stare of stars.  
They seem restless, but maybe they're  
just ink blots and I'm the one who's really restless.  

There is something here that repeals me.  
In its own abundance I am absent.  
So I shouted at the desert spirits,  
tell me your secrets or I will tell you my sorrows.  

The spirits lined up quickly then.  
Wings fluttering. Hearts astir.  
I heard many voices become one  
and it spoke to the leafless sky  
as a tenet to earth.  

We hold no secrets.  
We are simply windows to your future.  
Which is now and which is then  
is the question we answer.  
But you ask the question.  
If there is a secret we hold  
it is nothing emboldened by words  
or we would commonly speak.  

I turned to the voice,  
what wisdom is there in that?  
If words can't express your secret wisdom,  
then I am deaf and you are mute and we are blind.  
At least I can speak my sorrows.  

Again the wings fluttered  
and the voices stirred hoping the sorrow would not spill  
like blood upon the desert.  

But there were no more sounds  
save the coyote and the owl.  
And then a strange resolution suffused my sight.  
I felt a presence like an enormous angel  
carved of stone was placed behind me.  
I couldn't turn for fear its loss would spill my sorrow.  
But the swelling presence was too powerful to ignore  
so I turned around to confront it,  
and there stood a trickster coyote  
looking at me with glass eyes  
painting my fire, sniffing my fear,  
and drawing my sorrow away in intimacy.  
And I understood the nature of angels.
