Temptress Vision
----------------

A temptress vision has encircled me like a   
willful shadow of a slumbering dream.  
Is it the powerful light of purpose?   
If I squint with all my strength I may see it.  
Always must it be inside of me  
like a pilot fish inseparable from its host.  
It fearlessly drinks my essence.  
Such a bitter taste I muse.  
Spit it out upon your table of perfection.  
Compare this grain of sand with your galaxy.  
This spire of sorrow with your deepest eye.  
If my callous mind can see you,  
there are no interventions.  
No pathway away.  
Convergence.  

I am a lock-picker.  
A tunnel-digger.  
A fence-cutter of the wicked watchers.  
A traveler that has sought   
the mystery that eludes all but the outlaws.  
The wild-eyed, unrelenting fools of purpose  
that remain outside the laboratory of wingless flight.  

You are the eternal Watcher   
who lives behind the veil of form and comprehension,   
drawing forth the wisdom of time  
from the well of planets.   
You cast your spell and entrain all that I am.  
Am I just a fragment of your world?  
A memory hidden by time?  
A finger of your hand driven by a mind  
unfamiliar with skin.  
Touch yourself and you sense me.  
Visions wild with love.  
Splendor that beckons like a secret whisper of gladness  
spread on the winds by an infinite voice.   
The sound of all things unified.   
I am part of that voice.   
Part of that sound.   
Part of that secret whisper of gladness.  

This limitation must end in lucid flesh.  
The dream of sparks ascending  
quickening the cast of hope.  
Avoid the brand of passivity   
the signs complain.  
Shun manipulation before you are stained.  
Spurn all formula and write new equations   
in the language of sand.  
Heed no other,  
nor listen to the seduction of holy symbols  
standing before the windows of truth.  
Define from a foreign tongue.  

These are the battered keys   
that have led me to unlocked doors.  
Doors that collapse at a mere breath  
and behind which  
lay more pieces to collect for the Holy Menagerie.  
The never-ending puzzle.  

All the stars in the sky  
recall the purpose of your hallowed light.  
Burn a hole through the layers.  
Peel all the mockery away.  
Enjoin the powers   
to answer this call:  
Bring the luminous vision  
hidden behind the whirling particles  
of the Mapmaker.  
Let it enter me  
like a shaft of light that enters   
a cave's deepest measure.  
Ancient fires still burn in these depths.  
Who tends them?  
What eyes are watching?  
Waiting.  
Waiting for time's flower to bloom.  
To submerge in the relentless subtlety   
that moves beyond my reach   
with a jaguar's stealth.  
To dream of elder ways  
that leap over time   
and leave behind the puzzle of our making.  

O' temptress vision  
you steal my hunger for human light.  
If there is anything left to hollow  
let it be me.  
If there is anything left to cage  
let it run free.  
If there is anything left to dream  
let it be our union.
